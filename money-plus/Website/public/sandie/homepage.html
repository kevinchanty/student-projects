                Due to the impact of virus in the merchandising and purchasing for nearly 2 years, 
                being increasingly difficult to achieve target and performance. Many people have 
                changing their buying patterns, and started online shopping. The Information 
                Technology (IT) will be the major trend in the future. I want to take this 
                opportunity to making something different, step out of my comfort zone,
                and try a different job than before. In the future, I will humbly to learn
                more knowledge about programming, coupled with my past work experience, 
                hoping to be flexibly used in the future work.
